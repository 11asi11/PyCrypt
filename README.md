# PyCrypt
PyCrypt is a python script to encrypt and decrypt files
the script is encrypting using Fernet
in addition it generates a key for any password given
so its possible to encrypt with a nice and short password
that is easy to remember and not a long random key

PyCrypt is also capable to encrypt any type of file
because its using the bytes of the file to encrypt so
it does not matter what type of file is given
PyCrypt will handle it.
